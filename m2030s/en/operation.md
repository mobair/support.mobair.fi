# Operation

For optimal airflow and proper mixing of the supply air with the warm indoor air, there should be a ~15 mm gap between the unit and the wall. When the fan is on, existing warm air inside of the room flows through the gap into the unit and upwards towards the ceiling to warm up the incoming outdoor air. The energy consumption of the fan is only 1,0 W, so it can always be turned on. 

If the enclosed silencer is used, it should be installed inside of the air duct for last after the filter. The length of the silencer can be shortened by cutting. If the additional airflow limiter is used, please make sure the negative air pressure inside of the room does not become excessive.

An obstacle disturbing the airflow upwards (e.g. a pelmet in front of the unit), can produce a feeling of draught
