Start by making a ∅110 mm opening for the outdoor air duct. Then install the included ∅103 mm outdoor air duct into the opening, descending slightly outwards. Seal the indoor seam of the duct and the wall. The duct ending should be flushed with the wall.

Place and secure the outdoor louvre on the outer end of the duct. Installation of an insect net is optional. If an existing air channel is used you should install the enclosed air duct for properly fitting the filter.
